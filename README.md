# HindiNLP
A natural language processor project for Hindi.

This particular parser is constructed to parse phrases structured in formal present tense, utilizing Hindi words and characters. This parser checks for punctuation and grammar, and utilizes a local csv sheet with word definitions to do so. This project does work, however the dictionary our parser pulls from is limited. By improving the dictionary, the parser becomes more capable. 
Built for our class: Foundations of Automata at Eastern Michigan University, taught by Professer Sverdlik.
